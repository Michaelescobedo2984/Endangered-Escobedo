<h1>The gorilla you probably wont be able to see.</h1>
<hr>

<p>The eastern lowland gorilla—also known as Grauer’s gorilla—is the largest of the four gorilla subspecies. It is distinguished from other gorillas by its stocky body, large hands and short muzzle. Despite its size, eastern lowland gorillas subsist mainly on fruit and other herbaceous materials, just like other gorilla subspecies.</p>

<p>Years of civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have taken their toll on both the eastern lowland gorilla and the mountain gorilla. The eastern lowland gorilla makes its home in lowland tropical rainforests in the eastern DRC. In the last 50 years, its range has decreased from 8,100 square miles—about the size of the state of Massachusetts— to about 4,600 square miles today. This subspecies may now occupy only 13% of its historical range. There were nearly 17,000 eastern lowland gorillas in the mid-1990s but scientists estimate that the population has declined by more than 50% since then. An accurate accounting of the animals has been impossible for many years because of violence in the region.</p>

<p>Gorillas are important to indigenous communities: Many local indigenous tribes and communities living alongside the gorilla habitat consider the gorillas to be their patron gods. The Kisimba clan (Bahumba) believe they descended from the gorillas. Their traditional tale tells a story of a gorilla rescuing a man that was lost and stuck high up in a tree. To save the man, a gorilla climbed up the tree and gently placed him on his silver back before carrying him back to safety.</p>
